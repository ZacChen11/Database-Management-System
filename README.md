# Database-Management-System
This project is an implementation about simulations of operations in large database. There are two
relations Employees and Projects to be took into account. It will firstly sort both of the two
datasets in a given limit of memory size. In the next, it will join the two datasets under the same
memory limit. After the implementation, the performances of number of disk I/O and execution
time will be evaluated in the case of different memory limits and different size of datasets.
